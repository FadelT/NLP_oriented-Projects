# NLP_oriented-Projects

Hello There, Welcome!

NLP defined as Natural Langage Processing is quite an interesting domain in which we can process texts, retreive valuable information from texts and so on. Some example of tasks in this domain are: Text summarization, Topic modelling, Sentiment analysis.

In this part of my several projects, I build a search engine (text mining) like Google. The only difference is the database in where the documents are retreived from. The point is: You want to know information about some topic,  You just type the topic name ,and the function will point out all relevant documents related to that topic. 

The another task is PageRanking which is about the degree of popularity between serveral pages. But it can be applied to another domain such as identifying the most popular collaborator in the company based on the email they exchange with other collabortors (This is the task done here in PageRank ).
